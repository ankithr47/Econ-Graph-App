# Econ Graph App (Work in Progress)

Econ Graph App is an interactive revision tool designed to help students learn, draw, and interpret key economics graphs, with automatic feedback and guided explanations.

This project is currently under development. The repository reflects an evolving implementation rather than a finished product.

---

## Project Overview

Econ Graph App aims to support A-level and introductory economics students by improving graph literacy, a core skill assessed in economics exams.

The app is designed around a practice-first workflow where students actively draw graphs, receive feedback, and build intuition through repeated testing and explanation.

## Intended Features

### Interactive Graph Drawing
- Students will be able to draw essential economics graphs (e.g. supply and demand, cost curves, AD/AS).
- Drawn graphs will be automatically graded by comparison to reference solutions.
- Feedback will highlight correct components and areas for improvement.

### Step-by-Step Explanations
- Each graph will include structured explanations covering:
  - The meaning of each curve or line
  - Key intersections and regions
  - How the graph is used in economic analysis

### Practice and Testing
- Flashcard-style revision flow
- Opportunities to practice graph construction before being tested
- Immediate visual feedback to reinforce learning

---

## Motivation

Many economics revision resources focus on written explanations while offering limited support for learning how to construct and interpret graphs.

This project aims to address that gap by providing:
- Hands-on graph drawing practice
- Automated, objective feedback
- Clear links between graphical representation and economic meaning

## Current Status

This project is in progress. At the current stage:

- Initial project structure and UI scaffolding are in place
- Basic graph rendering and drawing components are under development
- Navigation and placeholder views have been implemented

Planned work includes:
- Autograding logic for drawn graphs
- A structured library of graph templates
- Explanation modules linked to each graph type
- Practice and test modes
